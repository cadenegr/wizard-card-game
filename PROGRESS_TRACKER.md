# 🎯 WIZARD Card Game - Progress Tracker

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES## 📋 NEXT ACTIONS
1. **PRIORITY 1**: Fix currentPlayerIndex synchronization - investigate why Bot 4 bids first but Bot 6 plays first
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Fix UI card display during trick-complete phase - cards should remain visible
3. **Analysis**: Check if startFirstTrick() currentPlayerIndex (4) correctly maps to first player
4. **Debug**: Add more logging to track currentPlayerIndex through phase transitions
5. Test with all player counts (3,4,5,6)
6. Create unit tests for turn order logicURRING)
1. **Turn Order Mismatch**: First to bid ≠ first to play (Console Evidence: Bot 4 bids first, Bot 6 plays first)
2. **Last Card Display**: Last card disappears before winner announcement (Console: "Cards to show: 5" then immediate trick-complete)
3. **Hard-coded Logic**: Need dynamic turn order based on pregame winner

### 🔍 CONSOLE LOG EVIDENCE (Latest Session)
```
Bot 4 started bidding: 0
makeBid: Bot 4 bid 0, current player index now: 1
...
startFirstTrick: currentPlayerIndex: 4, leadPlayer: Bot 5
DEBUG - Bot playing: Bot 6 (index 5), card: 8 of Blue
```
**Analysis**: Bot 4 (index 3) bid first, but Bot 6 (index 5) played first. Clear currentPlayerIndex desynchronization.

## ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING
- Clockwise seating layout: [1][2][3] top, [6][5][4] bottom
- Pregame phase with card dealing
- Seat-based bot naming (Bot 1 at seat 1, etc.)
- Basic turn progression in makeBid() method

## 🔄 CORE PROBLEMS TO FIX

### Problem 1: Turn Order Logic
**Issue**: `currentPlayerIndex` after pregame doesn't match who should bid/play first
**Root Cause**: `startFirstTrick()` using currentPlayerIndex (4) but Bot 6 (index 5) playing first
**Evidence**: Console shows Bot 4 bid first → Bot 6 played first (index mismatch)
**Solution Needed**: Fix currentPlayerIndex synchronization between bidding and playing phases

### Problem 2: Last Card Display
**Issue**: Cards vanish when trick completes before showing winner
**Root Cause**: UI stops showing cards when phase becomes "trick-complete"
**Evidence**: "Cards to show: 5 Phase: playing" → immediate "Phase: trick-complete" with no cards displayed
**Solution Needed**: Fix UI card display logic to handle trick-complete phase properly

### Problem 3: Hard-coded Assumptions
**Issue**: Logic assumes fixed player positions instead of dynamic turn order
**Root Cause**: Mix of seat-based and index-based logic
**Solution Needed**: Single source of truth for turn order

## � FIXES APPLIED (Current Session)

### ✅ Fix 1: Turn Order Hard-coding (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `startFirstTrick()` was hard-coding `currentPlayerIndex = 0`, ignoring pregame winner
**Location**: `/src/lib/gameEngine.ts` line 310
**Fix**: Preserve `currentPlayerIndex` from bidding phase, use it for `leadPlayer`
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING**

### ✅ Fix 2: Last Card Display Debug
**Problem**: Cards disappearing during trick completion
**Location**: `/src/lib/gameEngine.ts` `completeTrick()` method  
**Fix**: Added comprehensive debug logging, preserved `currentTrick` during `trick-complete` phase
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING**

## 🧪 TEST PLAN
1. Start 6-player game
2. Verify pregame winner bids first (check console logs)
3. Verify same player plays first card
4. Verify last card stays visible during winner announcement
5. Check console for "TRICK COMPLETION DEBUG" messages

## �📋 NEXT ACTIONS
1. Fix turn order: pregame winner must be first to bid AND first to play
2. Fix last card display with proper phase management
3. Test with all player counts (3,4,5,6)
4. Create unit tests for turn order logic

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Pregame winner bids first
- Same player who bids first plays first card
- Last played card stays visible during winner announcement
- Turn order follows clockwise progression consistently
