# 🎨 UI Framework Status - WIZARD Card Game

## ✅ **What We've Fixed**

### **1. Table Size Issue** 
- ✅ **Fixed**: Table now has **fixed dimensions** (`w-full h-96`)
- ✅ **No more shrinking** when game starts
- ✅ **Consistent layout** across all game phases

### **2. 4-Player Layout**
- ✅ **Position 1**: Top-left mantle (Bot 1)
- ✅ **Position 2**: Top-center mantle (Bot 2) 
- ✅ **Position 3**: Top-right mantle (Bot 3)
- ✅ **Position 5**: Bottom-center mantle (Human Player) - **Green mantle**
- ❌ Positions 4 & 6 removed (not used in 4-player game)

### **3. Card Specifications**
- ✅ **20% smaller cards**: `w-10 h-14` (was `w-12 h-16`)
- ✅ **Cards centered on mantles**: Positioned directly over each mantle
- ✅ **Human cards**: Face-up, clickable during play phase
- ✅ **Bot cards**: Card backs in fan formation, max 3 visible

### **4. UI Elements**
- ✅ **New Game button**: Moved to bottom-right corner outside table
- ✅ **Center game info**: Round, phase, trump suit
