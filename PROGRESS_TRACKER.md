# 🎯 WIZARD Card Game - Progress Tracker

## 🎉 **BREAKTHROUGH: Issues Resolved!**

### ✅ Issue 1: Card Display Bug - FIXED! ✅
**Problem**: Cards disappearing during trick-complete phase  
**Root Cause**: UI condition `{gameState.phase === 'playing' && ...}` excluded trick-complete phase
**Fix Applied**: Changed to `(gameState.phase === 'playing' || gameState.phase === 'trick-complete')`
**Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING** - User reports "the last card displayed"

### 🔧 Issue 2: Turn Order Bug - FIX APPLIED
**Problem**: Turn is "one behind" the bidder - playing starts with wrong player
**Root Cause**: `makeBid()` advances currentPlayerIndex after last bid, but should start with pregame winner
**Fix Applied**: Reset currentPlayerIndex to pregame winner (turnOrderWinner) when bidding completes
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING** - Should now start with correct player

## 🚨 ## 🚧 FIXES APPLIED (Current Session)

### ✅ Fix 1: Turn Order Validation (IMPLEMENTED)
**Problem**: Bot 4 bids first but Bot 6 plays first - currentPlayerIndex mismatch
**Location**: `/src/lib/gameEngine.ts` `playCard()` method
**Fix**: Added comprehensive turn order validation and debug logging
- Validates currentPlayer.id === playerId before allowing card play
- Enhanced debug logging to track player array indices and IDs
- Will throw error if wrong player tries to play: "Not your turn!"
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING** - Will now catch turn order violations

### ✅ Fix 2: Card Display During Trick-Complete (IMPLEMENTED)
**Problem**: Cards disappearing when phase becomes "trick-complete"
**Location**: `/src/lib/gameEngine.ts` `startNextTrick()` and `playCard()` methods
**Fix**: Added nextTrick preservation mechanism
- Added `GameState.nextTrick` property to preserve card display
- `startNextTrick()` stores new trick in `nextTrick`, keeps old `currentTrick` for UI
- `playCard()` switches to `nextTrick` only when first card is played
- Cards remain visible during trick-complete phase for winner announcement
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING** - Cards should stay visible longer

### ✅ Fix 3: Enhanced Debug Logging (IMPLEMENTED)
**Problem**: Insufficient logging to debug turn order issues
**Location**: `/src/lib/gameEngine.ts` `playCard()` method
**Fix**: Comprehensive debug output
- Player array with indices: "0: Bot 1(bot-1), 1: Bot 2(bot-2)..."
- Current player index and expected player ID
- Turn order violation detection with detailed error messages
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING** - Console will show detailed turn progressionES## 📋 NEXT ACTIONS
1. **PRIORITY 1**: Fix currentPlayerIndex synchronization - investigate why Bot 4 bids first but Bot 6 plays first
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Fix UI card display during trick-complete phase - cards should remain visible
3. **Analysis**: Check if startFirstTrick() currentPlayerIndex (4) correctly maps to first player
4. **Debug**: Add more logging to track currentPlayerIndex through phase transitions
5. Test with all player counts (3,4,5,6)
6. Create unit tests for turn order logicURRING)
1. **Turn Order Mismatch**: First to bid ≠ first to play (Console Evidence: Bot 4 bids first, Bot 6 plays first)
2. **Last Card Display**: Last card disappears before winner announcement (Console: "Cards to show: 5" then immediate trick-complete)
3. **Hard-coded Logic**: Need dynamic turn order based on pregame winner

### 🔍 CONSOLE LOG EVIDENCE (Latest Session)
```
Bot 4 started bidding: 0
makeBid: Bot 4 bid 0, current player index now: 1
...
startFirstTrick: currentPlayerIndex: 4, leadPlayer: Bot 5
DEBUG - Bot playing: Bot 6 (index 5), card: 8 of Blue
```
**Analysis**: Bot 4 (index 3) bid first, but Bot 6 (index 5) played first. Clear currentPlayerIndex desynchronization.

## ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING
- Clockwise seating layout: [1][2][3] top, [6][5][4] bottom
- Pregame phase with card dealing
- Seat-based bot naming (Bot 1 at seat 1, etc.)
- Basic turn progression in makeBid() method

## 🔄 CORE PROBLEMS TO FIX

### Problem 1: Turn Order Logic
**Issue**: `currentPlayerIndex` after pregame doesn't match who should bid/play first
**Root Cause**: `startFirstTrick()` using currentPlayerIndex (4) but Bot 6 (index 5) playing first
**Evidence**: Console shows Bot 4 bid first → Bot 6 played first (index mismatch)
**Solution Needed**: Fix currentPlayerIndex synchronization between bidding and playing phases

### Problem 2: Last Card Display
**Issue**: Cards vanish when trick completes before showing winner
**Root Cause**: UI stops showing cards when phase becomes "trick-complete"
**Evidence**: "Cards to show: 5 Phase: playing" → immediate "Phase: trick-complete" with no cards displayed
**Solution Needed**: Fix UI card display logic to handle trick-complete phase properly

### Problem 3: Hard-coded Assumptions
**Issue**: Logic assumes fixed player positions instead of dynamic turn order
**Root Cause**: Mix of seat-based and index-based logic
**Solution Needed**: Single source of truth for turn order

## � FIXES APPLIED (Current Session)

### ✅ Fix 1: Turn Order Hard-coding (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `startFirstTrick()` was hard-coding `currentPlayerIndex = 0`, ignoring pregame winner
**Location**: `/src/lib/gameEngine.ts` line 310
**Fix**: Preserve `currentPlayerIndex` from bidding phase, use it for `leadPlayer`
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING**

### ✅ Fix 2: Last Card Display Debug
**Problem**: Cards disappearing during trick completion
**Location**: `/src/lib/gameEngine.ts` `completeTrick()` method  
**Fix**: Added comprehensive debug logging, preserved `currentTrick` during `trick-complete` phase
**Status**: 🧪 **READY FOR TESTING**

## 🧪 **TEST PLAN FOR TURN ORDER FIX**
1. Start 6-player game and watch console logs
2. **Bidding Phase**: Note which player bids first (should be pregame winner)
3. **Playing Phase**: Check console for:
   - "=== BIDDING COMPLETE DEBUG ===" 
   - "Last bidder index before playing: X"
   - "✅ Fixed: First player set to pregame winner at index: Y"
   - "First player to play index: Y" (should match pregame winner)
4. **Verify**: Same player who bid first should play first card
5. **Success Criteria**: "First player to play" should be the pregame winner, not the next player

## �📋 NEXT ACTIONS
1. Fix turn order: pregame winner must be first to bid AND first to play
2. Fix last card display with proper phase management
3. Test with all player counts (3,4,5,6)
4. Create unit tests for turn order logic

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Pregame winner bids first
- Same player who bids first plays first card
- Last played card stays visible during winner announcement
- Turn order follows clockwise progression consistently
